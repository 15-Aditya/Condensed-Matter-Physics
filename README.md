# Non-Hermitian SSH Systems
Contains a few numerical codes I wrote to reproduce the results in paper: 
1) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14944](url) This paper discusses the use of Petermann factors to detect exceptional points. <br \> Codes are in `Non-Hermtiain systems` folder 
2) [https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0082214](url)
